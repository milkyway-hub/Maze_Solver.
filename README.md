# Maze_Solver.

Maze solving is a widely studied problem in computer science and artificial
intelligence due to its practical relevance in areas like pathfinding, robotics, and game
design. It involves navigating from a defined starting point to a destination within a
structured grid, typically representing the maze. The complexity arises from the
presence of obstacles (walls) that limit possible movements and necessitate the use of
algorithms to systematically explore potential paths.

This project focuses on implementing and visualising maze solving using
Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). These two
algorithms are fundamental in graph traversal and pathfinding. While BFS is known
for its ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted maze, DFS may find a path
faster but doesn’t guarantee it to be the shortest. By combining theoretical
understanding with practical implementation, this project provides insights into the
strengths and limitations of these algorithms.

The maze is represented as a 2D grid where:

● # represents walls that cannot be traversed.

● . represents open spaces that can be navigated.

● * is used to mark the solution path once found.
